        <p>Thus far, we have gone through setting up our computers for the class. The time allocated for lunch is very nice, but also seems strangely long.</p> <p> I think that I will grow to like it. Some of the topics that we have covered are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Goals and outcomes of the course</li>
            <li>Computer setup</li>
            <li>Aliases</li>
            <li>Command line functions?</li>
            <li>Git/github</li>
        </ol>
