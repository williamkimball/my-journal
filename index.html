        <h2>Day 1 May 21, 2018</h2>
        <p>Thus far, we have gone through setting up our computers for the class. The time allocated for lunch is very nice, but also seems strangely long.</p> <p> I think that I will grow to like it. Some of the topics that we have covered are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Goals and outcomes of the course</li>
            <li>Computer setup</li>
            <li>Aliases</li>
            <li>Command line functions?</li>
            <li>Git/github</li>
        </ol>
    </article>

        <h2>Day 2 May 22, 2018</h2>
	<p>Today was mainly spent building on the concepts that we had started yesterday. Much more with git/github (which is great since I can already see an improvement in my skills with it) an then we went on tho creating a page using HTML, which was fairly easy. After I completed those tasks, I was given a more advanced task that basically had me completely refactor what I had already written to make it component based. I like the ability to really see the progress that I am making and using what I know and what I know how to find in order to be better and figure things out. I think that covers today's topics for the most part. </p>
