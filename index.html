        <h2>Day 1 May 21, 2018</h2>
        <p>Thus far, we have gone through setting up our computers for the class. The time allocated for lunch is very nice,
            but also seems strangely long.</p>
        <p> I think that I will grow to like it. Some of the topics that we have covered are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Goals and outcomes of the course</li>
            <li>Computer setup</li>
            <li>Aliases</li>
            <li>Command line functions?</li>
            <li>Git/github</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Day 2 May 22, 2018</h2>
        <p>Today was mainly spent building on the concepts that we had started yesterday. Much more with git/github (which is great since I can already see an improvement in my skills with it) an then we went on tho creating a page using
            HTML, which was fairly easy. After I completed those tasks, I was given a more advanced task that basically had
            me completely refactor what I had already written to make it component based. I like the ability to really see
            the progress that I am making and using what I know and what I know how to find in order to be better and figure
            things out. I think that covers today's topics for the most part. </p>

        <h2>Day 8 May 31 2018</h2>
        <p>Wellllll I kinda screwed up and have forgotten to do this the past, uh, 5 days. Oops. We've covered a lot of things thus far, such as object creation and manipulation, and lots of fun function stuff. Friday was very cool, we took the Meyers Briggs (sp?) personality test, and were put into groups based off our results. We then created web pages, to describe ourselves. I found out that I have the same personality type as Elon Musk, which is probably the best thing I've ever learned about myself. Tuesday, we started off with an exercise that had to do with Object creation and I was severely thrown off balance, when I was informed that there was a potential problem with my payment. It turned out to be ok, but I spent a good 30 minutes working on it, and was flustered and off balance all day. Wednesday, we started on a getting familliar with the git workflow, which was really helpful. I had the general idea of how it worked, but until I saw it in action, I didn't get how revolutionary it is. We then were put into groups and given an assignment to create a basic webpage, and style it, and manage the whole thing on github. In hindsight, we problby spent way too long coming up with the fictional biography of our character, but overall I am fairly happy with how the git side of things worked together. I have to admit that I struggled a bit as there was no assigned group leader, and felt that terrible feeling I feel when there is an issue in a group with no leader. How's that for an articulate sentence? There were other factors influencing my flusteredness though but I should apologize regardless. Today, we pretty much spent the whole day working on that project, and then presenting it to the class. It was wierd how anxious I was, and how I felt once it was over. I hope to grow past presentation anxiety during this class. I enjoyed seeing how other groups took the same exact directions and interpereted them differently. I do feel, at this early point that I am much more naturally inclined to Javascript, and it gives me hope that I will be good at the back-end stuff. I also worked on getting my terminal to look like I want it to, but that's not really important, is it?</p>
