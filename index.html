    <h1>This is the Journal I am Going to be Keeping During my Time in NSS</h1>
    <p>Thus far, we have gone through setting up our computers for the class. The time allocated for lunch is very nice, but also seems strangely long. I think that I will grow to like it. Some of the topics that we have covered are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Goals and outcomes of the course</li>
        <li>Computer setup</li>
        <li>Aliases</li>
        <li>Command line functions?</li>
        <li>Git/github</li>
    </ol>
